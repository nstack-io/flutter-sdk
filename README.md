# NStack Flutter

[NStack] Flutter, provided as a plugin package, is a companion software development kit to the [NStack] backend.

See [NStack documentation](https://nstack-io.github.io/docs/docs/guides/flutter/flutter.html) for more information.

# How to use

## Install

To use [NStack], you will need your typical [build_runner] setup.\
First, install [build_runner] and [NStack] by adding them to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nstack:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/nstack-io/flutter-sdk.git
      ref: v0.1.4

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner:
```

This installs two packages:

- [build_runner], the tool to run code-generators
- [NStack] SDK, which includes a code generator

## Run the generator

Create a `nstack.json` file under `/lib` that holds your NStack details:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "nstack_project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  "nstack_api_key": "YOUR_REST_API_KEY"
}
```

Now, depending on your use case you have two possibilities to run the generator:

If your package depends on Flutter execute:
```console
foo@bar:~$ flutter pub run build_runner build
```
Otherwise execute:
```console
foo@bar:~$ pub run build_runner build
```

A successful execution generates your project tailored `nstack.dart` file.\
See example below on how to use your NStack instance.

### Incremental updates
To run a persistent build server that watches `nstack.json` to automatically trigger rebuilds execute:

```console
foo@bar:~$ flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
``` 

Now increment the `"version"` number and save (âŒ˜s) to trigger an update.


## Example

Import your `nstack.dart` file and plant your `NStackWidget` at the root of your application.\
Use `NStackInitWidget` for submitting [AppOpen] events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nstack_example/nstack.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(NStackWidget(child: MyApp()));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NStackInitWidget(
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text(context.localization.test.title),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
